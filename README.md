# Baris

Baris is a Rust crate for integrating to Salesforce. Baris supports the Salesforce REST, Collections, Composite, Bulk (2.0), and Tooling (partial) APIs, and provides extensive facilities for working with data over the API. Baris is async- and parallel-first, and requires the Tokio runtime.

Baris is intended to be the Rust answer to projects like `simple_salesforce` (Python) and JSForce (JavaScript).

Baris is free and open source, licensed under the BSD License and copyright (c) 2021 by David Reed. Baris is not an official Salesforce product and is not backed or supported by Salesforce.

The word βᾶρις (baris) is the name of a type of Ancient Egyptian ship described by Herodotus ([Book II, Chapter 96](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=2:chapter=96&highlight=baris)).
